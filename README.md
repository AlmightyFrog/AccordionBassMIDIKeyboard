# Accordion Bass MIDI Keyboard

This proof of concept converts USB keyboard input to accordion bass MIDI output.

Digital Accordions are quite rare and expensive.  
Have fun playing around using your favourite MIDI Instruments without the direct need to by one.

Focus has been put on traditional Stradella bass layout.  
As there are ergonomically only 4 rows almost properly spaced you only get counterbass bass major and minor.

Turn your keyboard 90 degree and lay it on left side of your MIDI keyboard for best experience.

## **LEAP** – **L**et **E**rrors **A**bort **P**romptly 
```
Don’t catch what you should crash.  
Crash early, crash clearly, crash fast.
```

**TLDR**: __If it can fail, let it fail – loud, proud and early.__

Principles:
- **Crash early, crash clearly** – Let errors appear immediately instead of hiding them.
- **Expose, don’t obscure** – Avoid over-engineered error handling that masks real problems.
- **Iterate boldly** – Fix issues as they appear, then **LEAP** again.

## Requirements

- Linux (tested on Arch)
- Python 3.8+
- Separate USB keyboard besides your main keyboard (not strictly necessary)

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Make sure your user has sufficieend acces rights to `/dev/input`.

```bash
# Start with automatic keyboard detection
python accordion_bass.py

# Or specify device and layout manually  
python accordion_bass.py --device /dev/input/event3 --layout stradella
```

Connect the MIDI port in your DAW.  
I use `Carla Plugin Host` where it is called `RtMidiOut ClientAccordion Bass`.

## Layouts
I use a english linux system but german QWERTZ keyboard layout, so maybe you need to fix mapping.

### Stradella
Main config is `config/stradella_layout.yml` as following:

```
Counterbass: [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0][ß][`]
Bass Notes:  [Q][W][E][R][T][Z][U][I][O][P][Ü][+]
Major:       [A][S][D][F][G][H][J][K][L][Ö][Ä][#]
Minor:       [Y][X][C][V][B][N][M][,][.][-][Shift][Space]
```

**MIDI Channels:**
- Channel 1: Control
- Channel 2: Chords (major/minor)  
- Channel 3: Bass notes

### SimpleBass Layout
Alternative config is `config/simplebass_layout.yml` which follows a simple pure chromatic schema across 4 octaves:

```
Row 1 (C1-B1):  [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][0][ß][´]
Row 2 (C2-B2):  [Q][W][E][R][T][Z][U][I][O][P][Ü][+]  
Row 3 (C3-B3):  [A][S][D][F][G][H][J][K][L][Ö][Ä][#]
Row 4 (C4-A#4): [Y][X][C][V][B][N][M][,][.][-][Space]
```

**MIDI Channels:**
- Channel 2: Row 3 and Row 4
- Channel 3: Row 1 and Row 2
